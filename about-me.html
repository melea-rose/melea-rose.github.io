  <p> Hi! My name Is Me'lea or Mea for short. I moved to Washington when I was 12 (2016) from Northern California.
    The part of Northern California where I am from is actually a neighboring town to Paradise (the one that had 
    the big fire last year). Some of my family members lost their houses in that fire. I am currently a running start highschool 
    junior.
